## Huginn &amp; Muninn; The Two Ravens ð“…‚ð“…‚

In myth Odin had two ravens named Memory and Thought; He would send them out across the world to collect knowledge and bring it back to him.

When I watched the presentation from Lilian and listened to him talking about all the camera traps collecting the memories and then being brought back in and analysed I imagined Memory and Thought and the metaphor stuck.
